# TiddlyWiki PM Plugin

This is a TW Project Management plugin.

This plugin is forked from version 0.0.45 of a previous plugin called `nico/pm`, which is a preogenitor to [[Projectify|https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Projectify]]. (I can no longer find `nico/pm` to make a direct attribution.) This plugin is indebted to Nico and that project for its basis, and may clobber some of the macros (at minimum) if installed alongside it; from 0.0.45 it followed a different opinionated development path based on my own use and needs.
